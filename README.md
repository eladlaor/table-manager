## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed.

### Usage

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

### Features

#### Editing Data

Double click on a cell in the table to edit its content.

#### Filtering Columns

Use the filter component to show or hide columns in the table.

#### Pagination

Navigate through pages of data using the pagination component.

Use the `src/config.ts` file to adjust the number of items per page.

The app also uses virtualization (react-window) for lazy loading in cases where there are many items per page.

Your changes will be saved even after closing and reopening the browser.
